Climate change is a serious global issue caused primarily by the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels. This leads to rising global temperatures, melting polar ice caps, and higher sea levels. Extreme weather events like hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires are becoming more frequent and severe. Human activities, including deforestation and industrial emissions, are accelerating these changes. To mitigate climate change, we must transition to renewable energy sources, reduce carbon emissions, and implement sustainable practices worldwide. Protecting biodiversity and raising awareness are also essential steps toward a sustainable future.
